# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description
The given project was to create a password generator that when loaded gives the user a series of prompts that will determine the criteria the password needs.
I chose to create arrays and use a while loop to cycle through and select a random element in the needed array. The thought process behind this was that this way the 
developer can restrict the special characters ect. that are allowed to be used in the generated password. Once the empty array cycles through the while loop and fills
up the the desired length with the desired letters, numbers and characters it will be random, but still in a pattern. This is why I created the shuffleArray
function, which takes the newly filled array and shuffles it once more, creating a secure and random password for the user.
